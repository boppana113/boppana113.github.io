          <h2>Purdue MIND</h2>
          <p>During my undergraduate studies at Purdue University, I founded Purdue MIND (Medical Innovation, Networking, and Design), a multidisciplinary student organization focused on promoting and expanding the biomedical engineering community. Purdue MIND provided undergraduate students with hands-on activities, research discussions, and networking opportunities with faculty members, including professors, physicians, and engineers.</p>
          <p>As the founder of Purdue MIND, my involvement was during my undergraduate years. The organization continues to thrive with its goals of extensive involvement in medical technology development, collaboration on significant projects, and recognition through national design competitions. You can learn more about Purdue MIND on their <a href="https://purduemind.com/">main website</a>. Stay updated with their latest news and events by following them on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/purdue.mind/">Instagram</a>. Additionally, you can find news about the organization, such as their participation in the "Maker" competition in China, on the Purdue University School of Biomedical Engineering <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME/AboutUs/News/2017/purdue-exomind-glove-team-travels-to-china-for-8220maker8221-competition">news page</a>.</p>
